# List all program display names, one-by-one matched with $binlist.
# Names with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.
#
# (Continued example:)
# namelist=('X session' Console FBTerm 'Sub menu')

# Type of the programs, one-by-one matched with $binlist.
# `C' for *C*onsole programs, which would be `exec'ed.
# `X' for *X* programs, which would be run with `setsid startx`.
#
# (Continued example:)
# flaglist=(X C C C)

# Index of the first item in the menu.

# Arguments with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.

# Alternative method of calling startx(/setsid). Should only be set if cdm
# does not start X as expected (bash -x shows call to setsid startx, but for
# no apparent reason does not start X).
# Only provided in the hope it may be useful, not a guaranteed fix.
